This is a series of blog posts about learning Nix, a reproducible build system. It covers official documentation and other resources, such as Nix Reference Manual, Nixpkgs manual, Nixpkgs search, Nix Pills, NixOS Wiki, and an opinionated guide. It also covers a Quick Start guide and Concepts, as well as a stream-of-consciousness blog series. It discusses the lack of automatically generated documentation and cohesive documentation strategy in the Nix ecosystem. The first installment of the series will cover how to create a flake from scratch.
