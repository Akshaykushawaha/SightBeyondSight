# SightBeyondSight
The project titled "Sight Beyond Sight" was our official submission for the OpenAI Stack Hack Hackathon, which was organized by Lablab AI and OpenAI with over 7000 participants across the globe. This project is a basic website that enhances online content accessibility for the visually impaired with a cost-effective text-to-speech service using contemporary AI tools.

With our website, visually impaired people can hear human-like text-to-speech. We strive to provide brief but informative image descriptions. Only relevant text is converted to speech. Chatbots will summarize and answer questions.
